    <h3> Vaccination</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Dog and puppies</li> </ul>
       <img class="top-img" src="puppy.jpg" alt="puppy"> The most suitable time for a puppy to take vaccination is at eight to ten weeks (four-six weeks can be, too). You should talk with vet to have a clear and flexible schedule for your cute hommies. After from 6 to 12 months of age, your pet will need a booster vaccination to ensure and maintain efficiency of the vaccination.
     <ul>
       <li>Cat and kitten</li> </ul>
       <img class="middle-img" src="kitten.jpg" alt="kitten"> There are two sets of vaccination to begin with. The first one is when your kitten reaches 9 weeks old and the second one should be occured at 3 month olds for boosting their immune system. Kittens and cats should be taken vaccination every 12 months (recommend).<br>
      <strong> You should also keep your kitten inside until it has fully received the required vaccination! </strong>
